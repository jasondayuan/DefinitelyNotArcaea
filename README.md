# DefinitelyNotArcaea
A 4k rhythm game made with Qt.

Note: Can only be used in Linux/MaxOS because path is used while coding.

Note: Before playing, go to notehandler.cpp and change the std::string PATH to the directory that this file is in.

e.g. If the absolute path of notehandler.cpp is /A/B/C/notehandler.cpp, then PATH should be /A/B/C/.

Note: In settings, the unit of 'Speed' and 'Offset' is miliseconds, and the 'Speed' corresponds to the miliseconds the note takes to get from the top of the window to the bottom of the window, so don't be suprised when you find that the note gets slower as you increase the number.

During gameplay, the four lanes(from left to right) corresponds to the 4 keys Q, W, O and P.
