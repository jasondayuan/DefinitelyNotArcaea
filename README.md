# DefinitelyNotArcaea
A 4k rhythm game made with Qt.

Note: Can only be used in Linux/MaxOS because path is used while coding.

Note: Before playing, go to notehandler.cpp and change the std::string PATH to the directory that this file is in.
e.g. If the absolute path of notehandler.cpp is /A/B/C/notehandler.cpp, then PATH should be /A/B/C.

During gameplay, the four lanes(from left to right) corresponds to the 4 keys Q, W, O and P.
